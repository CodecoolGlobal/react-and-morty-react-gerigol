# Rick and Morty React App

This React app allows users to explore characters and locations from the famous series Rick and Morty.

## Features

- **Homepage**: The homepage presents users with a Rick and Morty logo and two buttons to choose between viewing characters and locations.

- **Character List**: Clicking on the "Characters" button takes users to a paginated list of characters. As the user scrolls down, more characters are loaded dynamically from the API.

- **Character Details**: Clicking on a character card takes users to a detailed page about that character. It provides additional information about the character and a back button to return to the character list.

- **Location List**: Similarly, clicking on the "Locations" button leads to a paginated list of locations. More locations load as the user scrolls down.

- **Location Details**: Clicking on a location card shows detailed information about that location. It also displays characters associated with that location and allows users to click on a character to see their details.

## Future Feature Plans

I have exciting plans for enhancing the Rick and Morty React App in the future. Here are some of the features i'm considering:

- **AI-generated Planet Pictures**: WI'm exploring the possibility of integrating an AI picture generator to create unique and imaginative pictures for each planet in the Rick and Morty universe. This would add a visually captivating element to the app.

- **Character Search and Filtering**: I'm planning to implement a search and filtering functionality for the characters and locations. Users will be able to search for specific characters or apply filters based on attributes such as species, gender, and more.

- **Episode Details**: Adding a section to explore episode details, including summaries, air dates, and associated characters. This will provide a comprehensive view of the series' episodes.

These are just a few of the exciting features we're considering for future updates to the app. Stay tuned for more enhancements!
